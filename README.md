# Hi there 👋 
## Meditate ? 🤗 : code
### I am a passionate programmer who loves to solve problems by creating solutions that scale accordingly with the needs/time with minimal effort.
#### I am an expert in Python as you might have noticed on my profile and some public projects. But i love to use c++ and c whenever possible. 
#### I also love to muck around with linux -  a complicated relationship which i had for the whole of my current career 🐱
